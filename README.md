## description

***
 This Project involved creating a dashboard that provides weather conditions for cities. The user can enter a city name and it will search for and match the closest city with that name. It will provide current conditions in addition to a 5-day forecast. If it cannot find the city, it will alert the user. It will store the city in a list on the left side and as the user searches for more cities, they will be added to the list. The user is able to click cities that appear on the list to switch between them.<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:<br>
* WHEN I open the planner; THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
* WHEN I scroll down; THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours<br>
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day; THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
* WHEN I click into a timeblock; THEN I can enter an event<br>
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock; THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
* WHEN I refresh the page; THEN the saved events persist<br>
